# General description of the system  
  
The RPG card game is a turn-based strategy game where players use character cards and abilities to defeat an opponent. The game supports multiple modes:  
- **Player versus Player (PvP)**: Two players are fighting each other.  
- **Player versus Computer (PvE)**: The player fights with the AI.  
- **Campaign mode**: The player goes through a sequence of levels with story events and bosses.

- **The playing field**: Manages the maps and their placement.  
- **Players**: They manage their cards and moves.  
- **Cards**: Characters and abilities with unique characteristics.  
- **Game modes**: Define the logic for each mode (PvP, PvE, Campaign).
