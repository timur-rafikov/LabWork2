There are two types of cards: **characters** and **abilities**.  
The playing field consists of two halves on which the players place their cards. There is a **ranged row**, there is a **melee row** (which is closer to the middle). There are 4 cells in one row, and there can be a maximum of 8 cards on one half. Players are given **12 character cards and 10 ability cards**. When a player discards a card on the field, he can either use his available ability or not (but only one card per card).  
  
The winner is the player who has more **health for all remaining characters**.

1. **Health** (permanent)  
2. **Damage** (when activated)  
3. ** Healing to an ally** (when activated)  
4. **Protection Bonus for all allies** (permanent)
